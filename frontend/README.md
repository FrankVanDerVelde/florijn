# EWA - Florijn

## Frontend

### Vue 3
This project uses [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) as Frontend Framework

### Vite
Vue has it's own way to start up a webserver to host your Vue website on `localhost`.
It works fine but we chose to use [Vite](https://vuejs.org), it's way faster, and has handy features.

### Styling

#### CSS
In this codebase there are two ways to style web pages. The first is using regular CSS. In the `src/styles.css` you will find the color from our design system.
You can use them like so: 
```
.container {
  background: var(--primary-500);
}
```
#### Tailwind CSS
In this project you can also use Tailwind CSS. Tailwind can be used right inline with your HTML. It is also integrated with our design system colors.
```
